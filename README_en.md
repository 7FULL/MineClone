- Sound system
- Player system
- Inventory system
- Crafting system
- Recipe system adapted to be done with scriptableObjects from the editor
- Block breaking and placing
- Entity spawning system (works similar to the original Minecraft)

- Particles
- Optimization (chunks, face cooling, border cooling ...)
- Food system
- Health system
- Entity cap
- TNT (BOOOOM!!!)
- Item dropping system (for both entities and blocks)
- Biomes (currently there are 5, but the system is designed to support as many as desired)
- Layers system (forests, patches of gravel on the map... Fully customizable and scalable)
- Player UI very similar to the original
- ... And probably some more things that I'm forgetting, hahaha!
